This project predicts preseason AP Top 25 rankings using team offensive statistics and historical poll data from 2014 to 2024. The dataset combines scraped NCAA team performance metrics along with manually collected preseason AP and Coaches Poll rankings. The goal is to explore whether past performance and basic offensive stats can be predictive of preseason media expectations.
